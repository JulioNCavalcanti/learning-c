# Learning C

This repository will document my learning process in the C language. This challenge represents a unique experience for me, as I am dedicating myself to self-directed learning of the C language and have chosen to consume content exclusively in English, despite my basic level in the language.

This decision was influenced by a programmer I admire very much, called Fabio Akita, who recommends total immersion in the English language.

I'm aware that this will present an additional challenge, but I'm determined to tackle it as part of my commitment to learning C comprehensively and effectively. Over time, this repository will serve as a transparent record of my progress and the unique experiences that will arise during this learning journey.
